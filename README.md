# Containers

Implementation of the standart CPP containers library.
This is a team educational project developed by me and @tprobius at School 21.
That was our first project in C++ and that was hard :)

My part was:
- implementation of associative containers: Map, Set, Multiset.
  I used an AVL tree structure for this.

- Google test coverage.


## Here are some requirements we were given for this task:

- The program must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard using gcc compiler
- The program code must be located in the src folder
- Make sure to use iterators
- Classes must be template
- Prepare full coverage of container classes methods with unit-tests using the GTest library
- Copying of the Standard Template Library (STL) implementation is not allowed
- The logic of the Standard Template Library (STL) must be followed (in terms of checks, memory handling and behaviour in abnormal situations)
